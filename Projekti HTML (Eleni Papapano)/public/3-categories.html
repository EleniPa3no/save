				dance, as many other dance genres are based on <br>
				ballet. Ballet is based on techniques that have been <br>
				developed over centuries. Ballet uses music and dance to tell stories. Ballet dancers have the ability to <br>
				transport an audience to another world.

			<li> <h2>  Latin Dance </h2> 
			Latin dance is a fast-paced, often sensual, partner dance characterized by sexy hip movements. However, <br>
			hip movements are not intentional in any of the Latin dances. The hip motion is a natural consequence<br>
			of changing weight from one foot to the other.
